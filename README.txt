code/implementations/optimizations - Folders in which the different parts where optimized.
code/implementations/original - Implementation by van maatens, as cited in the paper.
code/implementations/tsne_exact - Instrumented version of the exact algorithm from the orginal.
code/implementations/tsne_nlogn - Instrumented version of the n log n algorithm from the orginal.
code/implementations/tsne_exact_optimizations - The instrumented version of the exact algorithm split up a bit more and with slight optimization.
code/implementations/tsne_exact_final - The algorithm with the basline, the best optimizations and benchmarking scripts.
code/implementations/utils - Utility scripts we wrote.
code/implementations/validation - Verification scripts we wrote.
data/ - Contains a script to generate data and the mnist dataset.

Other folders mainly contain benchmarking results or calulations based on them.
