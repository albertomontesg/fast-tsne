This is just a one-time hand in of the code and presentation. We used github for our developement (Alen is invited) and we refer to that for the commit history, and more details.

src/implementations/optimizations - Folders in which the different parts where optimized.
src/implementations/original - Implementation by van maatens, as cited in the paper.
src/implementations/tsne_exact - Instrumented version of the exact algorithm from the orginal.
src/implementations/tsne_nlogn - Instrumented version of the n log n algorithm from the orginal.
src/implementations/tsne_exact_optimizations - The instrumented version of the exact algorithm split up a bit more and with slight optimization.
src/implementations/tsne_exact_final - The algorithm with the basline, the best optimizations and benchmarking scripts.
src/implementations/utils - Utility scripts we wrote.
src/implementations/validation - Verification scripts we wrote.
data/ - Contains a script to generate data and the mnist dataset.
