# Implementations

Here should be the different implementations done during the project.
List of different implementations:

 - **Original**: original implementation offered [here](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) with minor changes:
    * [x] Read the MNIST dataset
    * [x] Check the results numerically
    * [x] Time it for performance benchmarks
 - **Naive**: O(n^2) version of the t-SNE algorithm (exact computation of the gradients):
    * [x] Check the numerical results
    * [x] Counting the flops performed
    * [x] Benchmarking infrastructure
