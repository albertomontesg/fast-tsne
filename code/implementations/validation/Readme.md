 - Store computations of each function. In the main loop every 250th iteration
 - Validate based on reference files (previously stored computations)
  
 - To store, run: make store_calculation_{f/d}
 - To validate, run: make validate_{f/d}
 
 - Results stored in ./calculated folder
 - Validation expects files in the ./reference folder
